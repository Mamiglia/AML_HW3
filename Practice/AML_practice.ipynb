        "   - Are there fluctuations in training and validation loss or accuracy? If so, what might be causing them?\n",

        "   - **Learning Rate:** Experiment with different learning rates (higher and lower values) to find an optimal rate.\n",
        "   - **Milestones:** Modify the milestone values for adjusting the learning rate schedule.\n",

        "   \n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Re-Training:** Train the model with the adjusted hyperparameters. Record the training progress and generate a new report, including performance metrics and line plots as before.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Final Analysis:** Analyze the results of the fine-tuned model and compare them with the initial training. Answer the following questions:\n",
        "   - Has parameter fine-tuning improved model performance?\n",
        "   - Did it mitigate overfitting or underfitting issues?\n",
        "   - What can you conclude about the optimal hyperparameters for this task?\n"
